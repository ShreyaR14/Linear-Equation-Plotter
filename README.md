# Linear-Equation-Plotter

This is an 8086 based assembly program that plots linear equations.

## Software

Software to run this program - emu8086

## Introduction

Here, we can plot 6 linear equations
```
1. y = b
2. y = -b
3. y = -mx + b
4. y = mx - b
5. y = -mx + -b
6. y = mx + b
```
The user can input the values of slope(m) and constant(b). Thus, the equation will be plotted on the graph.
